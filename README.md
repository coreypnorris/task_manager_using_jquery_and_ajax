This is a simple task list application where users can create tasks, mark them as complete or remove them. Each of these actions requires the page to be fully reloaded. Using this railscast as a tutorial (http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery-ajax-revised?view=asciicast) the goal is to add AJAX so that this can be done without a page reload.
